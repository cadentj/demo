            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKENS: "he".<br>PREVIOUS TOKENS: No interesting patterns.<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "he".<br>- The previous tokens have no common pattern.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples involve sentences where "he" is the subject.<br>- There is no specific context or topic that stands out.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- All activation values are 10.0, indicating that the neuron is highly activated by the token "he".<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- No, I don't see any other patterns.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None<br>- The top logits list contains unrelated words, mostly proper nouns or suffixes.<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The pronoun "he" as a subject in a sentence.
