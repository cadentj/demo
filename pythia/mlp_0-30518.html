            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKENS: "He".<br>PREVIOUS TOKENS: Various tokens, often punctuation marks, preceding the activating token.<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "He".<br>- The previous tokens are often quotation marks or punctuation marks, indicating a change in speaker or sentence.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples all involve a change in speaker, often in a quotation.<br>- The activating token "He" is used to indicate the speaker.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- The activation values are consistently high for all examples.<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- No, I think I've got it.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None<br>- The top logits list seems unrelated to the activating token or the patterns in the text examples.<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The pronoun "He" used to indicate a change in speaker, often in a quotation.
