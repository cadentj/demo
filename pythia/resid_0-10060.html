            <h3>Response:</h3>
            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKENS: "She".<br>PREVIOUS TOKENS: Various, including "route", "punishment", "Diwali", etc.<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "She".<br>- The previous tokens have no common pattern.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples all have "She" as the subject of the sentence.<br>- The sentences are all descriptive, often with "She" performing an action.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- The activation values are high for all examples, indicating that the neuron is highly activated by the token "She".<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- Yes, I missed one: The examples all seem to be from descriptive or narrative text.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None (the top logits list contains mostly non-words or incomplete words)<br>- The top logits list is uninformative in this case.<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The pronoun "She" as the subject of a sentence, often in descriptive or narrative text.
