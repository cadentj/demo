            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKENS: "She".<br>PREVIOUS TOKENS: No interesting patterns.<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "She".<br>- The previous tokens have nothing in common.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples involve sentences where "She" is the subject.<br>- The activation value is always high (10.0) for the "She" token.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- There is no variation in activation values, so no examples stand out as more representative than others.<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- Yes, I noticed that "She" often starts a new sentence or clause.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None<br>- The top logits list contains mostly unrecognizable characters and doesn't shed light on the neuron's behavior.<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The pronoun "She" at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
