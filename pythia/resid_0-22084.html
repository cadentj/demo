            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKENS: "he" (repeatedly).<br>PREVIOUS TOKENS: Various, but often preceding a verb.<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "he".<br>- The previous tokens have no clear pattern.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples involve a person, referred to as "he", performing an action.<br>- The activating token is a pronoun used to refer to a male person.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- The activation values are consistently high across examples.<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- Yes, I missed one: The text often appears to be describing someone's actions or behavior.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None (the list appears to be a mix of unrelated words and word fragments).<br>- The top logits list does not seem to provide any clear insights into the neuron's behavior.<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The pronoun "he" used to refer to a male person, often preceding a verb.
