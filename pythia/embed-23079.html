            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKENS: All examples have the token "interests".<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "interests".<br>- The previous tokens have nothing in common.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples all involve the concept of interests, often in a formal or professional context.<br>- The activating token is always a noun, referring to the interests of a person, group, or organization.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- The activation values are uniformly high across all examples, suggesting that the neuron is highly attuned to this specific token.<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- No, I don't see any additional patterns.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None<br>- The top logits list does not contain any tokens that are clearly related to the concept of "interests".<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The token "interests", often in a formal or professional context.
