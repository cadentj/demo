            (Part 1)<br>ACTIVATING TOKEN: "She".<br>PREVIOUS TOKENS: Various, but often a quotation mark.<br><br>Step 1.<br>- The activating token is always "She".<br>- The previous tokens have nothing in common, but often a quotation mark.<br><br>Step 2.<br>- The examples involve dialogue or quotes, where "She" is used to refer to someone.<br>- The activating token is often at the beginning of a quotation.<br><br>Step 3.<br>- The activation values are all equal and high, indicating that the neuron is highly activated by the token "She" in these contexts.<br><br>Let me think carefully. Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities? <br>- Yes, I missed one: The activating token is used to refer to a female person, often as the subject of a sentence.<br><br>(Part 2)<br>SIMILAR TOKENS: None, as the top logits list appears to be mostly noise or non-English characters.<br><br>[EXPLANATION]: The pronoun "She" at the start of a quotation, referring to a female person.
